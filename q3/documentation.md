# Question 3 Documentation

##Â PyTorch section

In this section we selected 5 random images from the COTS dataset. Then using the PyTorch transforms.functions module we implemented 2 different versions of the following data augmentation techniques:

- flipping
- saturation
- brightness

Finally we saved the augmented images to an output folder that could be zipped at a later stage for submission. The function used for saving the images was generated using chat-gpt4, aswell as the list comprehension used to get all the images as a list.
